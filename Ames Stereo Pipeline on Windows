Installing Ames Stereo Pipeline in a virtual machine on Windows 7

1) Install Docker

2) In Docker, pull ubuntu image:
   $ docker pull ubuntu@sha256:062bba17f92e749bd3092e7569aa06c6773ade7df603958026f5397431754c
(this is the tag for ubuntu14.04)

In Docker, make container for ubuntu with Windows Geohackweek2016 directory mapped to /Geohackweek2016
   $  docker run -i -t -v /c/Users/rah/Documents/Geohackweek2016:/Geohackweek2016 --name ubuntu2 ubuntu

This will allow us to see datafiles we use/create in Windows

later, to re-enter this container, 
   $ docker start -ai ubuntu2


3) In Docker, inside the ubuntu2 (or whatever you named it), 

   :/# cd /
   :/# mkdir ASP
   :/# cd ASP

Download latest ASP: 
    :/# wget http://byss.ndc.nasa.gov/stereopipeline/binaries/StereoPipeline-2.5.3-2016-08-23-x86_64-Linux.tar.bz2 --no-check-certificate
and unpack
    :/# tar -xvjf StereoPipeline-2.5.3-2016-08-23-x86_64-Linux.tar.bz2

Amend your PATH 
    :/# export PATH="~/asp/StereoPipeline-2.5.3-2016-08-23-x86_64-Linux/bin:$PATH"

Test to see if stereo runs:
   :/#  stereo --version

This generates the first of a succession of errors caused by missing support libraries (python, libsm6, libxext6, ...).  To fix these,
   :/# apt-get update
   :/# apt-get install python python-pip wget
   :/# apt-get install libsm6
   :/# apt-get install libxext6

4) When we exit this container all these improvements will be saved. Except for your $PATH! To save your path, write your environment 
file to the command line:
   :/# env
 and you will get lots of stuff. Near the end, find the line that looks something like
   PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/ASP/StereoPipeline-2.5.3-2016-08-23-x86_64-Linux/bin
Copy this line (highlight and <RETURN>) to place it in the clipboard
Add a PATH statement to your .bashrc file
    :/#  cd                     assures you are in your home directory
    :~#  echo "<paste>" >> .bashrc

Check by looking at .bashrc
    :~#  more .bashrc
Space to move through file. Your new path statement should be at the end.
